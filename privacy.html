<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: January 9, 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Vertical Habits ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.</strong> All data is stored locally on your device using browser localStorage.</p>

<h2>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your name (optional, provided during onboarding)</li>
<li>Habit tracking data (checkmarks, dates)</li>
<li>Session logs (climbing grades, notes)</li>
<li>Training preferences (discipline, goals)</li>
<li>Premium subscription status</li>
<li>Custom habits you create</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this data remains on your device. We cannot access it, view it, or use it in any way.</p>

<h2>Payment Processing</h2>
<p>Payments are processed securely through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS:</strong> Apple App Store (subject to Apple's privacy policy)</li>
<li><strong>Android:</strong> Google Play Store (subject to Google's privacy policy)</li>
<li><strong>Web:</strong> Stripe (subject to Stripe's privacy policy)</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not store, process, or have access to your payment information, credit card numbers, or billing details.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>
<p>We do not currently use any analytics or tracking services. Your usage of the app is completely private.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any user data with third parties because we don't collect any data to begin with.</p>

<h2>Data Export & Deletion</h2>
<p><strong>Export:</strong> You can export all your data at any time from the Profile tab in the app. This creates a JSON file containing all your habits, sessions, and preferences.</p>

<p><strong>Delete:</strong> You can delete all your data by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearing browser data/cache</li>
<li>Uninstalling the app</li>
<li>Using the "Reset All Data" option in the app (if available)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Offline Functionality</h2>
<p>Vertical Habits works entirely offline. The app uses a service worker to cache files for offline access, but this does not involve sending data to servers.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our app does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. Since all data is stored locally and we don't collect data, there are no age restrictions on app usage.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date will be revised accordingly. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Since all data is stored on your device:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have full control over your data</li>
<li>You can export it anytime</li>
<li>You can delete it anytime</li>
<li>No third parties have access to it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact us at:</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Privacy-First Design:</strong> Vertical Habits is designed with privacy as a core principle. All your data stays on your device. We cannot access it, and neither can anyone else. You have complete control.</p>
